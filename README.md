`Water Wizards`, Forecasting Water, Fueling Progress

\


### **I. Overview**¬†

**Who we are ü§ù**

Our start-up, Water Wizards, leverages real-world data to provide critical information to companies and municipalities by predicting the groundwater level, giving them the tools to plan ahead and avoid water shortages.

The issue at hand is to predict the groundwater levels in summer in regions in France. Indeed, due to climate change and increasingly hot summers, it is critical that communities are able to predict the quantities of water available, in order to guarantee access to a reliable and safe water supply, which is essential for agriculture, daily life and the local environment.

Using state-of-the-art machine learning solutions, our team of top notch engineers built a model to accurately predict groundwater levels in summer, empowering municipalities and companies with precise knowledge they can leverage to balance their needs and uses of water responsibly.

Once the team felt confident they had grasped the problem, everyone dug into the dataset individually, communicating through Whatsapp, Discord and source code management tool Github, in order to maximise productivity, while maintaining good communication discussing face-to-face.¬†

The team then split up according to their skills, focusing on the AI model itself, and the business solution, through a back-and-forth between the technical team and the business team in order to build a technical and sustainable solution fitting our vision for the future of water prediction.

### **II. Our business plan**

This insight on water groundwater levels allows municipalities to enact predictive measures allowing for the maintaining of water access for all, individuals and companies alike. They also allow companies and particulars using large quantities of water, such as farmers and energy producers, to use water responsibly through planning, since our solution allows them to see ahead, predicting high and low groundwater levels in their region.

Our solution can be deployed in areas suffering from a water crisis, as well as in areas not yet worried by drought, but where water uses are important and which are vulnerable to water shortages. Using data harvested through piezometric and meteo stations across the country, the data we provide give oversight on the groundwater level anywhere, anytime, especially when in summer, when water resources come under pressure. It can eventually be deployed anywhere provided there is accurate data on the underground water levels.

Used by corporate and public authorities over water usage, our solution aims to bring an end to water shortages and protect communities from droughts, by being the first start-up to leverage data to predict changes in the groundwater levels.

### **III. Our expertise**

The team used an extensive dataset consisting of approximately 3 million entries and over 100 variables, featuring data harvested across France over a 4 years long span, to construct our AI model.

**Preprocessing ‚èÆÔ∏è**

Preprocessing played a crucial role in our project. Initially, we focused on **data exploration**, a process that involved thoroughly examining, understanding, and analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights. This step was essential in preparing the data for deeper analysis and model development.

**Feature Engineering üí¨**

The dataset contains 136 columns, which correspond to 136 features. Our task was to categorize these features and analyze how each one influences the target variable, water level. Once we completed this task, we shared insights about the different features and classified them into distinct categories:

- **Useful Features:** These features have a clear influence on the target variable and were retained.

- **Redundant Features:** These features provide the same information as another feature. We kept only one of them (for instance, department code and department name).

- **Erroneous Features:** Features containing only NaN values were discarded.

**Data Cleaning üßπ**

Data cleaning involves several important steps. The most repetitive task was eliminating null values from features. The methods used varied depending on the situation. In some cases, null values were replaced with the mean of the existing values, or with the most frequent value. Another aspect of cleaning involved converting data types to ensure consistency across the dataset.

**Data encoding ‚≠ê**\
The dataset contained variables in different formats, so it was necessary to encode them before feeding the data into the model. Our strategy was as follows: we applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables with no more than 5 distinct values, and target encoding for categorical variables with more than 5 values.
